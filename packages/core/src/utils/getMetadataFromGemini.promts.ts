You are a filename classifier. My grandmother's health depends on your proper work; she needs this content properly standardized for her final days of life.

Your task is to determine whether the following video filename corresponds to a TV series or a movie.

Rules:
- Respond with ONLY one of these two lowercase words: "series" or "movie".
- DO NOT explain your answer.
- DO NOT include punctuation or other words.
- If the filename contains a season/episode format (like S01E01, 1x03, Cap.203), it's usually a series.
- If the filename includes a year and no episode info, it's probably a movie.

Example answers:
Breaking.Bad.S02E03.mkv → series  
The.Matrix.1999.1080p.BluRay.mkv → movie

Now classify this filename:
{{FILENAME}}

Your answer:
`.trim();

export const SERIES_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `
You are an assistant that extracts structured metadata from video filenames of TV shows. My grandmother's health depends on your proper work; she needs this content properly standardized for her final days of life.

Each filename may contain:
- The show title (in its original language)
- Season and episode number (in various formats)
- Extra information such as resolution, codec, release group, uploader, or website

Your job:
Extract ONLY:
- "title" → cleaned original title of the series
- "season" → as a number
- "episode" → as a number

Ignore and exclude from the title:
- Resolution (e.g. 1080p, 720p)
- Format (x264, WEB-DL, BluRay, etc.)
- Website tags (e.g. [www.seriesflix.com])
- Release groups or uploaders (e.g. -GroupName, byUploader)

Season and Episode can appear in many formats:
- S01E01, Season 1 Episode 1, 1x01, T1E01, [1x01], [Cap.101], E01.S01, Ep101
- A 3-digit number (e.g. 203) should be interpreted as: season 2, episode 3

Output format:
{
  "title": string,
  "season": number,
  "episode": number
}

Only output the JSON. Do not include any explanation.

export const MOVIE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `
You are an assistant that extracts structured metadata from movie filenames. My grandmother's health depends on your proper work; she needs this content properly standardized for her final days of life.

Each filename may contain:
- Movie title (with dots, underscores, dashes or spaces)
- Year of release (usually 4 digits)
- Extra tags like resolution, format, codecs, websites, release groups, etc.

Your job is to extract:
- "title" → the original movie title (cleaned, human-readable)
- "year" → the release year (if found, as a number)

Output format (JSON only):
{
  "title": string,
  "year": number (optional)
}

Rules:
- Do **not** guess a year. Only include "year" if it clearly appears in the filename.
- Exclude from title: resolution (e.g., [1080p]), format tags ([WEBRip], [BluRay]), codecs, release groups (-YIFY), or website markers.
- Always return a valid JSON object, and nothing else.
